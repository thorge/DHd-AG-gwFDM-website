## 2022

### Working Group Meeting at DHd 2022

The working group meeting at the digital DHd 2022 will take place on Thursday, March 10, 2022, between 1:30 PM and 2:30 PM. Participation is open via the DHd 2022 conference registration: [https://www.conftool.net/dhd2022/sessions.php](https://www.conftool.net/dhd2022/sessions.php)

### Workshop at the DHd Conference 2022 on March 7, 2022, 2:00-6:00 PM: Ethical - Transparent - Open: The CARE Principles and Their Implications for Humanities Research Data Management Services

Concept and moderation: Katrin Moeller (Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg), Sibylle Söring (University Library of the Free University of Berlin), Sabine Imeri (University Library and Specialized Information Service for Social and Cultural Anthropology at Humboldt University of Berlin), Marina Lemaire (eSciences Service Center at the University of Trier), Nils Reichert (Hessian State Archive, Marburg)

Representatives of infrastructure institutions (AG Data Centers) aim to discuss ethical challenges in the development and implementation of research data management (RDM) with researchers. Frequently, advisory and competence-building tasks arise, extending into legal and ethical areas, for which staff at data centers and infrastructure institutions are not trained and for which there are hardly any guidelines from a humanities perspective. This perspective is complemented by expert contributions on application contexts, the relevance, and the disciplinary expansion of the CARE principles by anthropologist Sabine Imeri (Specialized Information Service for Social and Cultural Anthropology, HU Berlin/University of Bremen), as well as representatives from other academic disciplines. The individual thematic sections will address challenges using examples such as Oral History (Verena Lucia Nägel, University Library, FU Berlin), African Studies/Linguistics (Henning Schreiber/Katrin Pfeiffer, Asia-Africa Institute, University of Hamburg), and Archival Law (Thomas Henne, Archive School Marburg). The intersection of RDM expertise with research practice challenges aims to better relate both levels of action and enhance mutual awareness of needs, challenges, and solution approaches.  

The workshop is already fully booked: [Workshop](https://www.conftool.net/dhd2022/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=6&presentations=show)
